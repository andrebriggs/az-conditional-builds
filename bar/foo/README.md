# A change here should trigger a build

An add of a new file didn't trigger. Adding this line to modify

I made a mistake in the path so updating again

No since adding an exclusion to MD file this will not trigger a build...WRONG it updated

I made a change to the exclusion syntax based on this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/triggers?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#wildcards
